# Password-Generator
Random password generator

I originally wanted to create check boxes and number sliders to set the criteria of the password, but the homework guide requires prompts to be used.

When the website is loaded up, you can click generate password, it will then open a series of prompts on the page.

type a number between 8 and 128 for password length.

type either 1 for yes to lowercase letters or 0 for no to lowercase letters.

type either 1 for yes to uppercase letters or 0 for no to uppercase letters.

type either 1 for yes to numbers or 0 for no to numbers.

type either 1 for yes to symbols or 0 for no to symbols.

password will then be generated in the text box.

This exercise teaches the importance of Java Script and how it can be used to create complex engines such as a random password generator. 
this homework provides practise on how to use arrays, functions and logic to create these systems.
